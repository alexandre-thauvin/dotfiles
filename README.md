Here are my config for i3 WM on archlinux including also several scripts such as:
- Config file for Kitty
- Set random wallpapers from a folder with 5 minutes rolling
- A script lock script that set a random wallpaper from a folder to i3lock
- Some utilities script such as some superfind and superkill
- A mr_clean to delete tmp files
- Some yabai scripts
- A few Android utilities scripts such as show_running_activities that display the current stack of activities of a desired app (via its package name)
